I started my agency 7 years ago while working full-time on my startup, building
an ecommerce marketplace mobile app called Localyyz ([read about it
here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/localyyz-1-trending-app-shopify-store-stefan-suppa)).

I worked 16hr days. 7 days a week, for better part of an entire year.

Thinking back, this is succeeding on hard mode. I don’t recommend it.

My now fiancee told me she was close to breaking up with me during that time,
I had no life besides working all the time, I ignored everything else.

When I made the decision to go full-time on my agency, I was anxious.

Didn’t know what was going to happen, but I had a whole plain in my head, set
aside around $20k and gave myself a year to work my way up to $150k/y salary.

Looking back, I was worrying for absolutely no reason at all.

Took me about 3 month to land my first client, 6 months after that to land my
first big long-term client, within the first year I was making more than my
full-time salaried job.

Yes I do feel lucky, but I believe things would've worked out either way.
