In 2024, hiring internationally should not be an issue.

Most employers in the US/Canada advertises on their job posting that they only
hire in the US or Canada.

Let me give it to you straight: unless there are data security clearance
concerns, there're no reasons why a US employer cannot hire you as a remote
contractor.

Unfortunately, this is not a well-known fact by both the contractors and the
employers. Some education might be required.

Again, marketplaces solve this problem for you and we'll discuss the trade offs
in another chapter. So let's assume you're like me, who wants to build the
relationships with the customers off of marketplaces.

So, What can we do?

First you have to be truthful with yourself, are you're willing to work during
your employerâ€™s core work hours?.

If you're in Europe working for a US company, that means you might have to stay
up at 12am for a planning meeting.

If you're in Asia, you might have to work nights.

You have to figure that out for yourself. On legal and payment side of things,
tools like Stripe Atlas, Deel & Wise make it easy to setup legal entities and
bank accounts in the US to bypass any legal concerns that your employer may
have.

Let your employer know that there are tools such as wise.com and deel.com to
help bridge the international hiring gap.

In 2024, hring internationally is no longer an issue.
