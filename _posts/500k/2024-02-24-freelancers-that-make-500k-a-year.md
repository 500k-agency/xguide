So, you're in the freelancing or agency game, and you're chasing that
dream of raking in $500,000 a year. There's a trick to bagging more deals, and
it's all about timing your follow-ups like a pro.

## Why Did They Ghost Me?

Ever had a potential client just vanish into thin air after you thought things
were going well? It's happened to the best of us. Most of the time, they're just
swamped and forgot to hit you back. It used to bug me a lot, especially after
I put in weeks trying to gel with their team.

### Here's What I Figured Out: Chill and Wait

I landed one of my biggest gigs ever because I decided not to sweat it after
getting ghosted. I did everything by the book: chatted up the CTO on Slack, aced
my interviews, and even got the team nodding along to my ideas. But
then—poof!—nothing.

Here's How It Went Down

- Made a buddy inside the company (yeah, the CTO was my guy).
- Found the perfect time to pitch (they were looking for someone like me).
- Wowed their socks off (everyone loved my ideas and the work I showed).

And then... crickets. I waited for over three months before I pinged them again,
catching them up on what's new with me and that I'm still up for grabs. Boom!
Got a reply the same day, and we picked up right where we left off.

That gig turned into a 1.5-year adventure, netting me around $400k. It was the
jackpot that helped me scale my one-man show into something bigger. I juggled
a few smaller projects on the side and easily hit the $500k/year mark. Plus, the
app we built together was a hit, and I'm still tight with the CTO and the crew.

### The Game Plan

So, what's the takeaway here?

- **Don't sweat the small stuff**: Getting ghosted? It happens. Use it as a cue
  to step back and wait for the right moment to reach out again.
- **Always be cool about feedback**: Good or bad, it's gold. It helps you tweak
  your game.
- **Timing is everything**: Sometimes, doing nothing is doing something. Give it
  time, then hit them up again when you've got something new to share.


Real Talk

Following up after getting ghosted and being patient turned one of my biggest
letdowns into a major win. It showed me that sometimes, the best move is to just
hang tight and wait for the perfect moment to make your move.

### Key Tips for Freelancers and Agency Owners:

- **Keep at it**: A no today could be a yes tomorrow. Don't give up on leads too
  quickly.
- **Wait for it**: Good things come to those who wait (and then follow up).
- **It's all about who you know**: Making friends inside a potential client's
  company can make all the difference.

## Wrapping Up

VSo, there you have it. Making your freelancing or agency business hit that
$500,000 mark isn't just about non-stop hustling; it's also about playing it
smart with your follow-ups and knowing when to push and when to pause. Keep
these tips in mind, and you'll be on your way to landing those big deals that
can really change the game for you.
