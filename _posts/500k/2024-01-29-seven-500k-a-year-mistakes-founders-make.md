I wrote about 7 Mistakes I see agency owners make, too good to keep a secret:

1. **Afraid of rejection**. Scared to ask for what they want, afraid to be told no.
   Hence trapping themselves in the same situation again and again.

2. **Solution mode too early**. Didn't listen to the client enough to understand the
   core problem, jumped into problem-solving mode way too early.

3. **Failed to identify champion**. Not enough time was spent on building trust, did
   not identify an internal champion who would help to close the deal.

4. **No follow through**. After the initial contact, nothing was done to keep the
   client in-the-loop and updated with your availability and offer.

5. **Unrealistic expectations**. Never specified the expected outcome, over-promised
   in the scope. Did not set-up the engagement as an experiment instead of
   working deliverables.

6. **Broken system**: Running an agency is as much about building repeatable systems
   as build a product company.

7. **Scaling too early**: It's tempting to hire all your friends when you land that
   second client. But pay attention to your margin.
