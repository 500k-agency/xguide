After 7 years of running a 1-person dev agency, here’s my honest take on how to
find success.

**1. Start by picking something you can do really well.**

I started working for myself because I knew I could do it better. Of course,
I also had the biggest ego of anyone I know. But the truth is, if you don’t
think you can do it better (or don’t care), then you probably won't have the
urge to work for yourself in the first place.

**2. Listen to people who’s hiring.**

Most people don’t want to broadcast their problems in the open. But if the
problem gets big enough, they tend to look for people to solve it for them. If
you don’t know what problems to solve, this is a great way to find one.

**3. Offer your help.**

When you find a problem worthwhile solving, you’ll probably be itching to get
started. Offer your help, but don’t just dive right in. Start slow, answer some
emails and see if you can solve their problem that way. The problem may not
actually be that big, or the customer isn’t as invested in solving it as they
initially said.

**4. Build an audience.**

Are there a lot of people solving the same problems, and are they hiring people
to solve it?  This is the easiest way to find something that’s both worthwhile
and have a big enough market for competition. Unless you’re super confident
you’ll be the best, you don’t want to niche too down. Find a big problem that
you can comfortably be above average, and do good work there.

**5. Don’t quit your day job (yet).**

Finding a good problem to solve will take time, and you might lose interest.
You’ll still need to get compensated for your time, so make sure you can make
a living from solving these problem first.

**6. Write it all down.**

Content is great marketing. Lots of people write about nothing, don’t be one of
them. Write down what problems you found, why they’re worthwhile of solving, and
how you might be able to help.

**7. Be a voice in your community.**

If you’ve found a big problem that needs to be solved by lots of people (the
best are simple solutions to a big problem), teach it to other people. Your goal
isn’t to horde a problem and solve it all by yourself, your goal is do solve it
better, and together with smart people.

**8. Find focus and raise your price.**

If everything goes well, you’ll be seen as a capable expert in your field. When
you get busy and need to turn away clients, raise your price and pick only the
best clients for you to work with. You’ll be happier and get more free time
back, and do great work at the same time. This is what we set out to find in the
first place.
